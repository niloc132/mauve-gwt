    <title>Mauve JUnit bridge</title>
  <body>
    <h1>Mauve JUnit bridge</h1>
    <p>Allows JUnit tests to be run inside the Mauve Harness. This is a
     complete implementation of the JUnit core API, with the additional
     functionality to make every JUnit test case automatically runnable
     inside Mauve. To achieve this, two changes to the API have been applied:
     Both the TestCase and TestSuite class implement gnu.testlet.Testlet,
     which makes them a Mauve Testlet. The methods Assert have been prepared
     so that they call into the TestHarness check() methods when beeing
     run inside a Mauve TestHarness. Otherwise they throw AssertionFailedErrors
     like the standard JUnit implementation.</p>
