This is Mauve, a free test suite for the Java Class Libraries.

Mauve is intended to test several different varieties of the
libraries.  For instance, it will contain tests that are specific to a
particular JDK version.  Tags in the test files help the test
framework decide which tests should or should not be run against a
given runtime.


To build, first run configure.  You can control the configuration with
some environment variables:

     JAVA   Name of Java interpreter to use
     JAVAC  Name of Java (to class) compiler to use
     GCJ    Name of Java (to object) compiler to use

GCJ is only used when the `--with-gcj' option is given to configure.

Use `make check' to run the tests.  (This will change a little once
the tag code has been written.)
