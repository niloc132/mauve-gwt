This is Mauve, a free test suite for the Java Class Libraries.

Mauve is intended to test several different varieties of the
libraries.  For instance, it will contain tests that are specific to a
particular JDK version.  Tags in the test files help the test
framework decide which tests should or should not be run against a
given runtime.


To build, first run configure.  You can control the configuration with
some environment variables:

     JAVA   Name of Java interpreter to use
     JAVAC  Name of Java (to class) compiler to use
     GCJ    Name of Java (to object) compiler to use

GCJ is only used when the `--with-gcj' option is given to configure.

Use `make check' to run the tests.  You can set the make variable
`KEYS' to select a subset of the tests.  KEYS is a list of keys that
must be matched by the files to be tested.  Some values:

     * Any key with a `.' is taken to be the name of a class hierarchy.
       E.g., the key `java.lang' matches only test classes in java.lang.*.
       If multiple keys of this type, a test file need only match one
       to be included.

You can use `make recheck' to re-run `make check' with the key list
you last used.
